Ethereum is providing developers with the tools to build decentralized applications.
In the Ethereum blockchain, instead of mining for bitcoin, miners work to earn Ether, a type of crypto token that fuels the network.

Beyond a tradeable Cryptocurrency Ether is also used by application developers to pay for transaction fees and services on the 
Ethereum network.
There is a second type of token that is used to pay miners fees for including transactions in their block, it is called gas.
Every smart contract execution requires a certain amount of gas to be sent along with it to entice miners to put it in the blockchain.


CREATE A PRIVATE ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN

Download GETH - https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/
Geth is a multipurpose order line apparatus that runs a full Ethereum hub executed in 'Go' language. 
It offers three interfaces: the direction line subcommands and choices, a Json-rpc server and an intelligent comfort.


CREATE A GENESIS BLOCK & CONFIGURE

The genesis block is the first block of the blockchain. 
As there is no reference to a previous block, the properties of the genesis block is usually hardcoded into the software, as seen in
genesis.json. 
In genesis.json you will configure the properties of the blockchain. It is like the “settings” for your blockchain. 
For example, the chain configuration, level of difficulty to mine blocks, etc.

There are 4 required values (config, difficulty, gasLimit and alloc) you need to specify in genesis.json.

  "config": {
